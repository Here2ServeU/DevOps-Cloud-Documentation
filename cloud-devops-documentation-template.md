# Cloud & DevOps Engineer Documentation Template

This comprehensive documentation scaffold is designed to support Cloud and DevOps Engineers in organizing and sharing project knowledge effectively. It provides a structured format for documenting infrastructure setup, automation scripts, CI/CD pipelines, observability, runbooks, and tool configurations.

---

## 1. Infrastructure Overview

### Architecture Diagram
Provide a high-level visual diagram that illustrates the cloud infrastructure setup. Use tools like Lucidchart or draw.io to design a diagram that outlines the key components, such as VPCs, subnets, instances, databases, and load balancers.

```

```

### Cloud Resources
Document the core cloud resources provisioned for the project:
- **VPC CIDR**: Main address space (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`)
- **Public Subnets**: For internet-facing resources (e.g., `10.0.1.0/24`, `10.0.2.0/24`)
- **Private Subnets**: For internal services (e.g., `10.0.10.0/24`, `10.0.20.0/24`)
- **EKS Cluster**: Kubernetes orchestration (e.g., `t2s-eks-cluster`)
- **RDS Instance**: PostgreSQL with Multi-AZ for high availability

### Security
Detail the cloud security configurations:
- **IAM Roles**: Defined in `modules/security/iam.tf` for resource access management
- **Security Groups**: Firewall rules in `modules/networking/security-groups.tf`
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Protects against common web threats using AWS WAF v2

## 2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

### Directory Structure
Organize Terraform modules and environments clearly:
```
terraform/
├── modules/          # Reusable modules for infrastructure components
│   ├── vpc/          # VPC setup
│   ├── eks/          # Kubernetes cluster setup
│   ├── rds/          # Relational database configuration
│   └── alb/          # Application Load Balancer
├── environments/     # Per-environment configuration
│   ├── dev/
│   ├── stage/
│   └── prod/
├── variables.tf      # Input variables
├── main.tf           # Main infrastructure logic
├── outputs.tf        # Output values
└── terraform.tfvars  # Variable values
```

### State Management
Use remote backend storage to manage Terraform state files:
- **S3 Bucket**: `devops-tfstate` to store the state file securely
- **DynamoDB Table**: `terraform-locks` for state locking and consistency

### Terraform Workflow
```bash
terraform init                            # Initialize provider plugins and backend
terraform plan -var-file=dev.tfvars       # Preview changes for dev environment
terraform apply -var-file=dev.tfvars      # Apply the changes to provision resources
```

---

## 3. CI/CD Pipeline

### Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions / Jenkins / GitLab**: For automation and deployment pipelines
- **Docker & ECR**: Container image building and storage
- **Helm & EKS**: Deployment of containerized apps to Kubernetes
- **Trivy**: Container image vulnerability scanning

### Sample Workflow
A GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy an application to EKS:
```yaml
name: Deploy to EKS

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Build & Push Docker Image
        run: |
          docker build -t my-app .
          docker tag my-app:latest $ECR_URL/my-app:latest
          docker push $ECR_URL/my-app:latest

      - name: Deploy to EKS
        run: helm upgrade --install my-app ./helm-chart
```

---

## 4. Monitoring & Logging

### Observability Stack
- **Prometheus**: Collects metrics from Kubernetes workloads
- **Grafana**: Visualizes time-series data using Prometheus
- **ELK Stack or Datadog**: Centralizes logs from all services
- **Alertmanager**: Routes alerts via email, Slack, etc.

### Common Alerts
Set up monitoring alerts to detect and respond to anomalies:
- CPU utilization > 80% sustained for 5 minutes
- Memory usage > 85%
- Disk utilization for RDS exceeds 90%

---

## 5. Runbooks

### Example Runbook: Pod CrashLoopBackOff
Create detailed troubleshooting guides for recurring issues:
```markdown
## Problem:
Pod is restarting repeatedly in CrashLoopBackOff state on EKS

## Steps to Resolve:
1. Inspect logs using: `kubectl logs <pod-name>`
2. Identify root cause: memory issues, bad image, etc.
3. Verify container resource requests and limits
4. Restart pod or re-deploy with fixes
5. Escalate to DevOps lead if unresolved after 15 minutes
```

## 6. README Template

Create a README.md file in your project root to onboard developers quickly:
```markdown
# Project Name

## Description
This project provisions infrastructure and application components using Terraform and Kubernetes.

## Requirements
- Terraform >= 1.5
- AWS CLI
- kubectl

## Setup Instructions
```bash
cd terraform/environments/dev
terraform init
terraform apply
```

## CI/CD
CI/CD pipeline is configured in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

## Observability
Refer to Grafana dashboard for metrics and Alertmanager for alerts.
```

---

## 7. Best Practices

- Use remote state for Terraform with locking
- Always pin Terraform provider versions
- Apply principle of least privilege with IAM
- Break down Terraform code into reusable modules
- Define lifecycle rules for storage buckets
- Keep secrets out of version control (use SSM or GitHub Secrets)
